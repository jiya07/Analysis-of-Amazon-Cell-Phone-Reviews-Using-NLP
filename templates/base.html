								style="width:400px;height:250px;margin-left:15px" class="img-rounded"> Nowadays,
							approximately 85% of the consumers trust online reviews as much as recommendations from
							relatives and friends while buying something online.Amazon is one of the best mobile
							applications which is considered as a treasure trove of all mobile reviews, and their review
							system is accessible across all channels presenting reviews in an easy-to-use format. This
							tells how many people around the world are affected by these reviews before they buy mobile
							phones online. Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze
							thousands of reviews of unlocked mobile phones sold on amazon.com to find insights with
							respect to reviews, ratings, price, and the relationships among them.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>This project focuses on building a Sentiment Analysis model using Natural Language Processing
							(NLP) with Deep Learning to predict the sentiment of a review on mobile phones depending on
							the text of the review and the ratings. It helps in predicting if the review was positive or negative.
							The model is trained using

								Cell Phones Reviews dataset</a> which is extracted from Kaggle and contains 82,815
							reviews from
							Amazon about cell phones from 2004 up until Sep 2019. This model is built using Deep
							Learning and is able to make predictions with 80.6% accuracy.</p>
